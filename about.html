  <h1> About this website </h1>
  <p>My name is Faith Raymond.I created this website to boost the self-confidence of women.</p>
<p>  We have been told for genarations that you have to be skinny to look beautiful</p>
<p>  in the eyes of the world well i'm here to tell you that is a lie.</p>
<p>  I hope that this website will change your perpective of the word "beatiful"and</p>
  <p>that you don't have to be a certain size or shape to be beautiful and that beauty comes from within.</p>
